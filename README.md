# 🌀 TMPland — The Temporal Land of All Stuff

Welcome to **TMPland**, a mystical realm where time blurs, bits dance, and everything is... temporary — much like your system’s `/tmp` directory, but way more magical.

---

## ✨ What Is TMPland?

TMPland is not just code — it's a metaphorical universe built around the idea of **transience**. Much like how `/tmp` in Linux systems holds temporary files, TMPland is your staging ground, your sandbox, your ephemeral playground.

* It’s **my website for 2023–2024**, hosted as a living, breathing map of thoughts, projects, and experiments. ([GitHub][1])
* It’s also code — via `TMPland.py`, scripts, data — that governs how the site is built, managed, and evolves.
* Think of it as a **temporal frontier**, where nothing is permanent, everything is in motion, and every visit reveals something slightly different.


## 🧠 Philosophy & Inspiration

Why build TMPland? Because `/tmp` is a beautiful concept:

* In Linux, `/tmp` is a directory for **temporary files**, often cleared on reboot, often shared by many processes. ([The Linux Documentation Project][2])
* It symbolizes **impermanence**, **creativity**, and low-risk experimentation. ([Wikipedia][3])
* Sometimes, we need a space where things can exist, be useful, and disappear — and TMPland is my digital echo of that.

## 🌌 Final Thoughts

TMPland is a fleeting canvas. It’s about **moments** — small experiments, ephemeral data, creative detours. It’s not about permanence; it’s about the beauty of the temporary.

Welcome, wanderer. May your stay in TMPland be brief, curious, and full of wonder.
